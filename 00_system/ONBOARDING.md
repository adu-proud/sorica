# Realm Startup Protocol

Use once for a new research Realm.

The agent starts this protocol automatically when `AGENTS.md` is read and the user asks to start the Realm, the configuration or blueprint still contains required placeholders, or either file contains `setup_status: cli_started`.

If the user already ran `npm run llm-onboard`, the agent must treat those answers as the setup draft and complete startup without repeating questions unless a required field is missing or a risky assumption blocks mapping. Startup means translating the setup draft, marking setup complete, and running the first mapping pass.

## Steps
1. Inspect `02_user_realm/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md` and `00_system/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md`.
2. Create a short todo list with the CLI's todo/task tool if available. This is mandatory when the tool exists. Minimum todo items:
   - inspect setup draft,
   - verify Root Vault,
   - synthesize blueprint/config,
   - initialize aggregator,
   - run initial mapping.
3. Treat CLI-generated answers as a setup draft, not as questions to repeat.
4. Translate the draft into a usable research configuration before mapping:
   - preserve the project title and description,
   - register helpful artifact URLs or file paths,
   - infer a tentative source universe, vocabulary, methods, outputs, and mapping target from the description, artifacts, and Root Vault,
   - keep inferred fields explicitly marked as inferred when useful.
5. Use shell/file tools to confirm the Root Vault path exists and is treated as read-only.
6. If artifact URLs are present, use web/MCP/browser tools only when `external_sources_allowed` is set to `yes`. If the policy is `no`, record URLs but do not fetch them.
7. Fill `02_user_realm/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md`.
8. Fill `00_system/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md`, especially `root_vault_path` and source policy. Replace `setup_status: cli_started` with `setup_status: realm_started` in both startup files when translation is complete.
9. Audit the translation before moving on:
   - every project detail from the CLI draft is preserved or intentionally summarized,
   - every artifact URL or file path is listed,
   - every source policy and protected path is reflected in configuration,
   - inferred scope, source universe, vocabulary, methods, outputs, and initial mapping target are present where useful,
   - anything not translated is listed as deferred with a reason.
10. If `01_llm_realm/06_research_tendencies/RESEARCH_NEED_AGGREGATOR.md` does not exist, create it from `01_llm_realm/06_research_tendencies/RESEARCH_NEED_AGGREGATOR_TEMPLATE.md`.
11. Run `00_system/INITIAL_MAPPING_PROTOCOL.md`. Do this in the same turn as startup unless blocked by a missing required field, an unreachable Root Vault, or required external URL permission.
12. Use `00_system/STARTUP_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for the final response. Report the completed startup checklist, followed by a `Next Steps` section with 3 to 5 concrete actions the researcher can ask for next.

Do not ask follow-up questions before step 11 unless a required field is absent, the Root Vault path cannot be located, external URL access needs permission, or a risky assumption blocks immediate mapping. The user's `start the Realm` prompt is already permission to run initial mapping.

Use the CLI's todo/task tool if available to track startup; this is mandatory when the tool exists. Keep the todo list in the tool UI, not in the Realm, unless the researcher asks for a written checklist.

Use the CLI's question/input tool for required questions. If no question tool exists, ask in chat. Keep questions short and grouped only when unavoidable.

## Do Not Stop Early
- Do not stop after reading files.
- Do not stop after creating only a source map.
- Do not ask whether to run initial mapping after the user has said `start the Realm`.
- Do not leave `setup_status: cli_started` in the blueprint or configuration after translation.
- Do not report startup complete unless the setup draft was translated, the translation audit passed, the aggregator exists, and initial mapping ran or is explicitly blocked.

## Final Response
Use `00_system/STARTUP_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`. End the startup response with a short `Next Steps` section. Suggestions should be operational and specific to the mapped Root Vault when possible. Use options like:
- extract first evidence fragments from a named source batch,
- build the first concept index from repeated themes,
- answer a source-grounded research question,
- deepen mapping for a specific folder or source type,
- run a Tacito contradiction, anomaly, or negative-case pass.

## Minimum Research Blueprint
- Project title
- Project description
- Helpful artifact URLs or file paths, if any
- Root Vault path
- Evidence standards
- External source policy

## Minimum Configuration
- `root_vault_path`
- `root_vault_mode`
- `source_policy`
- `external_sources_allowed`
- `preferred_llm_cli`
- `claim_standard`
- `l2_policy`

## Suggested Question Groups
Keep setup short. Ask for:
1. Project name.
2. One free-form project description.
3. Helpful artifact URLs or file paths.
4. Root Vault path.
5. External source policy.
6. Preferred LLM CLI.

Do not ask the researcher to separately define scope, research object, current questions, source types, methods, outputs, vocabulary, or blind spots during fast setup. Infer those later from the description, artifacts, and Root Vault unless the researcher offers them or the missing detail blocks the immediate task.

## Done When
- Root Vault is protected and locatable.
- Configuration points to the Root Vault.
- `setup_status` is `realm_started` if the files were created by CLI setup.
- `RESEARCH_NEED_AGGREGATOR.md` exists.
- Initial source mapping has a clear target.

## Smoke Test
After startup, test with one small source batch:
1. Create one source map.
2. Extract one evidence fragment.
3. Link it to one concept index.
4. Back-search it.
5. Answer one small question with source path, evidence type, and evidence level.
