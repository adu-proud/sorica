# LLM Realm

LLM Realm is a Markdown framework for turning a large source collection into a searchable, source-grounded research workspace for LLM agents.

It keeps original material in a protected **Root Vault** and builds a lightweight **LLM Realm** beside it: 1:1 source copies with YAML headers, a shared dictionary, concept indexes, logs, and reports that help agents find and verify material without losing the original sources.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| bash | `>=3.2` (ships with macOS and most Linux distros) |
| Git Bash | Required only for Windows double-click onboarding |
| LLM agent CLI | Optional, but recommended: Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Kilo, or equivalent |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/llm-realm.git
cd llm-realm
bash bin/onboard.sh
```

On macOS, you can also double-click [`onboard.command`](./onboard.command). On Windows, install Git for Windows, then double-click [`onboard.cmd`](./onboard.cmd), which runs the same Bash onboarding script through Git Bash.

The onboarding command asks for the project name, Root Vault path, source policy, and preferred agent CLI. It writes the setup draft into:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`02_user_realm/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md`](./02_user_realm/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md) | Project description and research direction |
| [`00_system/instructions/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md`](./00_system/instructions/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md) | Root Vault path, source policy, protected paths, and evidence rules |

After onboarding, start your agent in this repository and ask it to start the Realm. The agent will follow [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), [`STARTUP.md`](./00_system/instructions/STARTUP.md), and [`ONBOARDING.md`](./00_system/instructions/ONBOARDING.md) to build the dictionary, generate source copy headers, and run a retrieval smoke test.

## Verify Setup

After the startup agent finishes, run:

```bash
bash bin/check-startup.sh
```

The check passes only when required placeholders are gone, `setup_status` is set to `realm_started`, the Root Vault path exists, and the startup aggregator has been created.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) | Main operating contract for autonomous agents |
| [`GLOSSARY.md`](./GLOSSARY.md) | Shared vocabulary for the framework |
| [`00_system/instructions/`](./00_system/instructions/) | Startup, routing, architecture, and configuration rules |
| [`00_system/sub_agents/`](./00_system/sub_agents/) | Sub-agent SOUL.md files for Conceptualizer, Navigator, Packer, and Checker |
| [`00_system/templates/`](./00_system/templates/) | Report templates used during startup and agent work |
| [`01_llm_realm/`](./01_llm_realm/) | Empty retrieval scaffold populated during startup |
| [`02_user_realm/`](./02_user_realm/) | Project blueprint and protected writing area |
| [`03_logs/`](./03_logs/) | Request, source intake, external query, and execution logs |
| [`05_agent_reports/`](./05_agent_reports/) | Generated reports, checkpoints, evidence packets, and verification notes |

## Core Workflow

```text
Root Vault
  read-only source corpus
        |
        v
Startup
  survey folders, create mirror indexes, run smoke test
        |
        v
LLM Realm
  searchable indexes, fragments, concepts, logs, reports
        |
        v
Agent work
  route request, retrieve evidence, synthesize, verify
```

Agents search `01_llm_realm/` first and open the Root Vault only when they need original context, unmapped material, or Checker verification.

## Agent Pipeline

| Stage | Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Conceptualizer | Turns a request into search concepts and a route |
| 2 | Navigator | Finds material in the Realm and Root Vault |
| 3 | Packer | Turns retrieved material into a report or structured answer |
| 4 | Checker | Verifies quotes, claims, paths, and index integrity |

The home session orchestrates the sequence through [`PROCESS_ROUTER.md`](./00_system/instructions/PROCESS_ROUTER.md).

## Rules To Preserve

- Keep the Root Vault read-only.
- Keep copied material in `01_llm_realm/sources/` limited to text-based source copies.
- Keep `02_user_realm/writing/` protected from agent edits.
- Require source paths for factual claims.
- Run Checker before presenting source-grounded claims as established.
- Keep a fresh clone bare: no project-specific logs, reports, or mirror indexes should ship in the repository.

## Useful Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bash bin/onboard.sh` | Collect setup answers and write the startup draft |
| `./onboard.command` | macOS launcher for onboarding |
| `onboard.cmd` | Windows launcher for onboarding through Git Bash |
| `bash bin/check-startup.sh` | Validate that startup completed cleanly |

## Fresh Clone State

A fresh clone is intentionally sparse:

- `01_llm_realm/sources/` has no project-specific source copies yet.
- `05_agent_reports/` is empty.
- `03_logs/` contains empty log scaffolds.
- `03_logs/research_tendencies/RESEARCH_NEED_AGGREGATOR.md` is generated during onboarding from its template.
- `REALM_CONFIGURATION.md` and `RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md` start with setup placeholders.
- `.trash/` is empty (retired files are archived here instead of deleted).

That is expected. The first real content appears only after onboarding and startup run against a real Root Vault.
