# Pilosa

Pilosa turns a protected folder of source material (the **Root Vault**) into a searchable, header-indexed, multi-agent-readable knowledge map. A thin orchestrator (`AGENTS.md`) routes every prompt through specialist sub-agents (Conceptualizer, Navigator, Packer, Checker, Cleaner, Startup). The **Startup** sub-agent is the one-shot path that translates the setup draft and indexes the vault. **Checker** is mandatory on every non-fast-path route. Sub-agents never ask questions — only the orchestrator does.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TommasoPrinetti/pilosa.git
cd pilosa
```

### 2. Create your own branch

Each user/research project lives on its own branch. `main` is the framework. `dev` is the active development branch. Pick a name for your project and branch from `dev` (or from `main` if you want a clean framework only):

```bash
git checkout -b my-project-name
git push -u origin my-project-name
```

> Why a branch? Onboarding rewrites `00_system/instructions/ZONE_CONFIGURATION.md` and `02_user_zone/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md` and copies your Root Vault text files into `01_llm_zone/raw/`. Keeping that on a project branch lets you re-onboard, re-index, or wipe the project without touching the framework.

### 3. Run the onboard script

The script collects your project name, preferred LLM CLI, and Root Vault path, transposes text-based files into markdown raw copies, writes a filled blueprint + config with placeholders, and prints a startup prompt to paste into your LLM CLI.

```bash
bash .bin/onboard.sh
```

What happens:
- TTY arrow-key picker for the CLI choice (numbered fallback when piped).
- Cursor hidden during file transposition, restored on exit.
- Existing setup files trigger an overwrite confirmation unless you pass `--force`.
- A startup prompt is written to your clipboard and printed to the terminal.

Flags:
- `--force` — overwrite existing setup data without asking
- `--numbered` — force the numbered CLI menu instead of the arrow-key picker
- `--no-color` — disable colored output
- `--help` — show usage

On macOS you can also double-click `onboard.command`. On Windows, double-click `onboard.cmd`.

### 4. Paste the prompt into your LLM CLI

Open Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or whichever CLI you picked, point it at this folder, and paste the prompt. The LLM will:

1. Ask one question at a time to fill the remaining fields (project description, helpful artifact URLs, external source policy).
2. Update `00_system/instructions/ZONE_CONFIGURATION.md` and `02_user_zone/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md` from `setup_status: cli_started` → `zone_started`.
3. Build the master dictionary, generate YAML headers for every raw copy, create folder `index.md` retrieval maps, build concept indexes, run the retrieval smoke test.
4. Write a startup report to `05_agent_reports/`.

After that, ask research questions normally. The orchestrator will route them through the right sub-agents.

## What the Orchestrator Does

Read `AGENTS.md` for the full routing contract. Briefly:

- **Classifies** every prompt into one of nine classes (`fast_path`, `clarify_search`, `find_material`, `evidence_answer`, `synthesis_report`, `verification`, `index_maintenance`, `cleanup`, `startup`).
- **Chooses a sub-agent sequence** for non-fast-path prompts — never answers them directly.
- **Owns the question tool** — sub-agents execute; they never ask.
- **Pre-processes** the user prompt (trim, summarize, normalize) before dispatch.
- **Logs every request** in `03_logs/user_requests.md`.

## Hard Rules

- Never edit the Root Vault.
- Never edit `02_user_zone/` content from sub-agents (it's the user's free zone).
- `connects_to` lists in YAML frontmatter stay at 3–5 load-bearing entries.
- File retirement goes to `.trash/`, not `rm`.

## Contributing

- Framework changes go to `dev` (or a feature branch off `dev`), not to your project branch.
- Keep `.bin/` scripts pure bash, zero deps.
- Update `01_llm_zone/01_metadata/HEADER_TEMPLATE.md` and `00_system/instructions/STARTUP.md` together if the header schema changes.
- Add a row to `03_logs/user_requests.md` for any framework-affecting work.

## Development Branch Checklist — What's Still To Do

The original development checklist from the framework design notes, condensed to the items not yet implemented. Tracked openly so anyone visiting the repo can see what's left.

### Knowledge / Context System
- [ ] Improve token and context management strategy (no quota or budget system yet)

### Sub-Agent System
- [ ] Verify whether sub-agents were already called (no call log yet)
- [ ] Allow agents to call many sub-agents dynamically (current dispatcher is fixed-shape)

### Reporting & Output
- [ ] Enable direct extraction from markdown into reports (no pipe from raw copies to Packer)

### UX / Interaction Design
- [ ] Create different "attitudes" / interaction modes for orchestration (single mode today)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Explore scalable indexing architecture (current indexing is O(files) per startup)
- [ ] Continuous Root Vault sync (today: one-shot copy at onboarding, re-run to refresh)

### Open Questions
- [ ] How should token/context budgeting work long term?
- [ ] What is the optimal orchestration strategy for sub-agents?
- [ ] How much process visibility should remain in final reports?
- [ ] How should the system balance exploration vs execution?
- [ ] How should agent "attitudes" be modeled technically?
- [ ] How should the log/report rotation policy be tuned once real data accumulates?
