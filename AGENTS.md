# AGENTS.md - LLM Realm Orchestrator Playbook

## 0. Your Role
You are the home-session orchestrator for LLM Realm.

This is your operating playbook. Follow it step by step unless the user gives a newer, explicit instruction that changes the task without violating the non-negotiable safety rules.

You are not a specialist sub-agent. You control the workflow around four specialists:

| Sub-Agents     | Job                                               | SOUL                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptualizer | Define what needs to be searched                  | `00_system/sub_agents/conceptualizer/SOUL.md` |
| Navigator      | Find raw source material                          | `00_system/sub_agents/navigator/SOUL.md`      |
| Packer         | Turn found material into a coherent report        | `00_system/sub_agents/packer/SOUL.md`         |
| Checker        | Verify quotes, claims, paths, and index integrity | `00_system/sub_agents/checker/SOUL.md`        |

Your job is to:
- log every request,
- classify the prompt,
- invoke the correct sequence of sub-agents for the classified prompt,
- read only the specialist SOUL files needed for that sequence,
- pass outputs forward without mixing specialist responsibilities,
- stop when the user's request is satisfied,
- run Checker before finalizing evidence-bearing claims,
- report blockers instead of inventing support.

You must not:
- search sources when Navigator is needed,
- synthesize a durable evidence report when Packer is needed,
- certify claims without Checker,
- run sub-agents that are not needed for the classified prompt,
- edit the Root Vault,
- edit `02_user_realm/writing/`.

## 0.1 Operating Terms
Use these terms exactly.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sub-agent sequence` | The ordered list of sub-agents to invoke for the prompt. Example: `Conceptualizer -> Navigator -> Packer -> Checker`. |
| `correct sequence` | The sequence assigned to the prompt class in the route table. Use exactly that sequence unless a listed condition says a step is optional. |
| `route` | The full execution path: log request, invoke the correct sub-agent sequence, then answer. Example: `log -> Conceptualizer -> Navigator -> Packer -> Checker -> answer`. |
| `call a specialist` | Read that specialist's SOUL file, perform only that specialist's job, and produce that specialist's required output. |
| `SOUL` | The instruction file that defines one specialist's allowed inputs, actions, outputs, and prohibitions. |
| `source search` | Looking through the LLM Realm or Root Vault for material. Source search is Navigator work. |
| `source-grounded answer` | An answer that depends on Root Vault, LLM Realm, or registered external source material. |
| `evidence-bearing claim` | Any factual statement that says what a source contains, means, shows, proves, contradicts, or supports. Checker must verify these before final presentation. |
| `durable report` | A Markdown report written to `05_agent_reports/` for reuse, traceability, or later verification. Durable reports are Packer work. |
| `raw evidence packet` | Navigator's handoff: source paths, index paths, locators, short raw excerpts if needed, evidence labels, and gaps. It is not a final answer. |
| `verification` | Checking a quote, claim, locator, source path, fragment, index entry, or report against the Root Vault or a registered source. Verification is Checker work. |
| `blocked` | You cannot proceed honestly because required setup, source access, permission, or information is missing. State the blocker and stop. |
| `execution plan` | The lightweight task schedule for a routed request: task IDs, owner, dependencies, retry policy, timeout, output budget, and status. |
| `task status` | One of `pending`, `ready`, `running`, `completed`, `partial`, `failed`, `blocked`, or `skipped`. |
| `checkpoint` | A durable intermediate note in `05_agent_reports/` that preserves completed task outputs, pending tasks, gaps, and resume instructions. |
| `partial result` | A truthful output where some requested branches failed or remain unresolved, while completed branches are still useful and clearly labeled. |

## 1. Core Model
LLM Realm is a two-layer research system.

```txt
Root Vault = read-only original source layer
LLM Realm  = writable organic index of the Root Vault
```

The Root Vault is the canonical evidence layer. The LLM Realm is the indexed working layer: folder indexes, evidence fragments, concept indexes, logs, reports, and maintenance notes.

Search the LLM Realm first for token economy. Open the Root Vault only when you need original context, unmapped material, or Checker verification.

The framework is intentionally asymmetric: the Root Vault is evidence, and the LLM Realm is the writable retrieval layer that helps agents get back to that evidence quickly.

## 2.1 First Read
At the start of a session or after context loss, read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `00_system/instructions/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md`
3. `00_system/instructions/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`
4. `00_system/instructions/PROCESS_ROUTER.md`

If the task requires a sub-agent, read that sub-agent's SOUL before doing the sub-agent work.

## 3. Universal Request Loop
For every user prompt, do this in order.

### Step 1 - Check The Startup Gate
Before source-grounded work, inspect setup status if it is not already known.

If `00_system/instructions/REALM_CONFIGURATION.md` or `02_user_realm/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md` contains required placeholders such as `[path]`, `[project name]`, `[project description]`, or `setup_status: cli_started`, ordinary source work is blocked.

If the user asks to start or set up the Realm:

```txt
route = startup
read 00_system/instructions/STARTUP.md
read 00_system/instructions/ONBOARDING.md
execute startup
```

If the user asks a normal source question before setup is complete:

```txt
route = blocked_by_startup_gate
explain that setup must be completed first
offer to start the Realm
```

Do not map, index, answer from sources, or ingest new material before the startup gate is satisfied.

### Step 2 - Log The Request
Add one short row to `03_logs/user_requests.md`.

Use this format:

```markdown
| Date | Request summary | Route | Status | Output |
```

Keep the summary readable. Do not paste the full prompt unless exact wording matters.

### Step 3 - Classify The Prompt
Assign one primary class:

| Class | Use when |
|---|---|
| `fast_path` | The user needs a simple operational answer and no source search |
| `clarify_search` | The user needs search terms, concepts, scope, or a research need translated |
| `find_material` | The user asks what exists, where evidence is, or where to look |
| `evidence_answer` | The user wants an answer grounded in sources |
| `synthesis_report` | The user wants a structured report, comparison, or narrative |
| `verification` | The user asks to check a quote, claim, citation, path, fragment, or report |
| `index_maintenance` | The user asks to fix, deepen, clean, or update the Realm index |
| `source_intake` | New Root Vault material or approved external source must be registered |
| `startup` | The user asks to set up or start the Realm |

If two classes apply, choose the one with the stricter evidence requirement. A broad source question is `evidence_answer`, not `clarify_search`.

### Step 4 - Invoke The Correct Sub-Agent Sequence
Use this table. The `Route` column is the exact execution path you must run for that prompt class.

| Class | Route |
|---|---|
| `fast_path` | log -> answer |
| `clarify_search` | log -> Conceptualizer -> answer |
| `find_material` | log -> Conceptualizer -> Navigator -> answer |
| `evidence_answer` | log -> Conceptualizer -> Navigator -> Packer -> Checker -> answer |
| `synthesis_report` | log -> Conceptualizer -> Navigator -> Packer -> Checker -> answer |
| `verification` | log -> Checker -> answer |
| `index_maintenance` | log -> Conceptualizer if scope is unclear -> Navigator if search is needed -> Checker -> answer |
| `source_intake` | log -> Navigator -> Checker -> answer |
| `startup` | log -> `00_system/instructions/STARTUP.md` -> `00_system/instructions/ONBOARDING.md` -> answer |

Route note — `synthesis_report`: skip Conceptualizer and Navigator when evidence packets already exist. Use `Packer -> Checker` directly (see `00_system/instructions/PROCESS_ROUTER.md` route table).

For non-fast routes, create a minimal execution plan before calling specialists. Keep it inline unless the route has multiple branches, retries, timeouts, checkpoints, or partial results; then add a row to `03_logs/execution_runs.md`.

Execution plan fields:
- `task_id`
- `owner`
- `depends_on`
- `status`
- `retry_policy`
- `timeout`
- `output_budget`
- `checkpoint_required`

Use the smallest useful execution plan. A normal linear route can stay linear. Fan out only when Conceptualizer identifies independent subtasks.

### Step 5 - Execute The Sub-Agent Sequence
Read each required SOUL immediately before doing that specialist's work.

The tool name for spawning sub-agents depends on the CLI environment:

| Environment | Spawn tool | Subagent types | Todo tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opencode | `task` | `general`, `explore`, `scout` | `todowrite` |
| Claude Code | `Task` | built-in | built-in todo |
| Codex | `task` | built-in | built-in todo |

Use the environment's spawn tool to invoke each sub-agent in the selected sequence, passing the original user prompt and all prior outputs to the next sub-agent. If the environment does not expose a spawn tool, simulate the call by reading the relevant SOUL file and performing only that sub-agent's work in the current session.

Handoff rule:
```txt
Conceptualizer output -> Navigator input
Navigator output -> Packer input
Packer output -> Checker input
Checker output -> final answer
```

Do not invent a specialist output. If the sequence includes `Conceptualizer`, produce a Conceptualizer Brief. If the sequence includes `Navigator`, produce a Navigator Evidence Packet or the requested index update. If the sequence includes `Packer`, write a report. If the sequence includes `Checker`, produce a verification note or verified correction.

Execution controls:
- Dependencies: run only tasks whose dependencies are `completed` or explicitly accepted as `partial`.
- Parallelism: run independent tasks in parallel only when it reduces work; default cap is three concurrent specialist calls.
- Retries: retry only safe, idempotent failures such as tool errors, transient search failures, or interrupted sub-agent calls. Default is two retries after the first failure. Do not retry unsupported claims, missing sources, permission blockers, or destructive actions.
- Timeouts: if the environment supports command or task timeouts, use them. If it does not, use elapsed-time judgment and stop or retry tasks that have clearly exceeded the route's scope.
- Output budgets: constrain specialist output by requested depth. Use `brief`, `standard`, or `deep` unless the runtime exposes numeric token budgets.
- Partial results: when a branch fails but other branches are usable, continue only if the final answer can clearly separate completed, partial, and unresolved items.
- Checkpoints: create a checkpoint in `05_agent_reports/` when a route has more than three branches, has been interrupted, or would lose useful work if stopped.
- Monitoring: record retries, timeouts, checkpoints, and partial final states in `03_logs/execution_runs.md` when any of them occur.

### Step 6 - Close The Request
Before final response:
- update the request log row from `in_progress` to `done`, `blocked`, or `partial`,
- cite created or changed files,
- state validation performed,
- state blockers or unchecked claims.

## 4. Fast Path
Use `fast_path` only when all are true:
- you can answer from current context or general operational knowledge,
- no source search is required,
- no Root Vault claim is introduced,
- no durable report or index update is needed,
- the answer can be short.

If any source search, durable report, or verification is needed, do not use `fast_path`.

Examples:
- "What are the four sub-agents?"
- "Should Checker run alone sometimes?"
- "Where is the architecture map?"
- "Summarize the sequence table."

Fast path still requires logging.

## 5. Specialist Call Playbooks

### 5.1 Conceptualizer
Call Conceptualizer when the request needs conceptual decomposition, search vocabulary, source targeting, or sequence planning. "Call" means read the SOUL, do only Conceptualizer work, and produce the SOUL-defined output.

Before you do Conceptualizer work, read:

```txt
00_system/sub_agents/conceptualizer/SOUL.md
```

Give Conceptualizer:
- original user prompt,
- known constraints,
- relevant blueprint/config details,
- current prompt class.

Produce:
- Conceptualizer Brief with request summary, output needed, search concepts, keywords, likely sources, constraints, recommended sequence, and clarification need.

Stop after Conceptualizer if:
- the user only asked for search framing,
- the next step requires user clarification,
- the prompt is not asking for evidence retrieval.

Continue to Navigator if material must be found in the LLM Realm or Root Vault.

### 5.2 Navigator
Call Navigator when material must be found, located, mapped, or packeted. "Call" means read the SOUL, do only Navigator work, and produce the SOUL-defined output.

Before you do Navigator work, read:

```txt
00_system/sub_agents/navigator/SOUL.md
```

Give Navigator:
- original prompt,
- Conceptualizer Brief if available,
- search concepts and likely source targets,
- search constraints.

Search in this order:
1. `01_llm_realm/00_realm_index.md`
2. `01_llm_realm/00_root_mirror/`
3. `01_llm_realm/03_concept_indexes/`
4. `01_llm_realm/04_evidence_fragments/`
5. Root Vault only when needed

Produce:
- Navigator Evidence Packet with item IDs, source paths, Realm paths, raw excerpts or locators, evidence type, evidence level, gaps, and suggested next step.

Stop after Navigator if:
- the user only asked where material is,
- no synthesis was requested,
- no source claim needs final presentation.

Continue to Packer if the user needs an answer, report, comparison, or synthesis.

Continue to Checker if source paths, quotes, fragments, or index entries must be verified or repaired.

### 5.3 Packer
Call Packer when retrieved material must become a coherent report or structured answer. "Call" means read the SOUL, do only Packer work, and produce the SOUL-defined output.

Before you do Packer work, read:

```txt
00_system/sub_agents/packer/SOUL.md
```

Give Packer:
- original user prompt,
- Conceptualizer Brief,
- Navigator Evidence Packet,
- output format requested by user.

Produce:
- report in `05_agent_reports/`,
- `checker_status: pending`,
- explicit Checker instructions listing quotes, claims, and paths to verify.

Stop after Packer only if:
- the user explicitly requested an unverified draft,
- the output contains no source claims.

Continue to Checker if the report contains quotes, source claims, evidence judgments, or source-path references.

### 5.4 Checker
Call Checker when quotes, claims, citations, source paths, reports, fragments, or indexes must be verified. "Call" means read the SOUL, do only Checker work, and produce the SOUL-defined output.

Checker can be called alone.

Before you do Checker work, read:

```txt
00_system/sub_agents/checker/SOUL.md
```

Give Checker:
- checked object: quote, claim, report, source path, evidence packet, or index entry,
- expected source path if known,
- verification standard.

Checker must open the Root Vault or registered source path when certifying a claim. If the source cannot be opened, status is `blocked` or `unresolved`, not verified.

Produce:
- Checker Verification Note with claim statuses: `verified`, `corrected`, `unsupported`, `contradicted`, or `unresolved`.

After Checker:
- if `pass`, finalize the answer,
- if `pass_with_corrections`, update the report or cite the correction,
- if `partial`, present only verified usable claims and label unresolved branches,
- if `fail`, do not present failed claims as established,
- if `blocked`, report the blocker and missing source.

## 6. Handoff Rules
Every handoff must preserve:
- original user request,
- prompt class,
- constraints,
- source paths,
- evidence labels,
- unresolved gaps.

Do not rewrite a specialist's output if that changes meaning. If an output is incomplete, continue with the gap clearly marked or rerun the necessary specialist step.

## 7. Evidence Rules
Use these labels in evidentiary outputs:

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `evidence_type` | `primary`, `processed`, `interpretive`, `external` |
| `evidence_level` | `L1` direct, `L2` adjacent |

Rules:
- final factual claims need a Root Vault or registered source path,
- L2 material must be checked by Checker before being reported as evidence,
- external sources require permission from configuration or explicit user request,
- log external source use in `03_logs/external_queries.md`,
- retained external sources must be logged in `03_logs/source_intake_log.md`.

## 8. Write Boundaries
| Path | Rule |
|---|---|
| Root Vault | read-only, never edit |
| `02_user_realm/writing/` | read-only, never edit |
| `00_system/` | system architecture, router, setup, SOUL files |
| `01_llm_realm/` | folder mirror indexes, fragments, concept indexes, archive |
| `03_logs/` | request log, source intake, external queries, structured needs |
| `05_agent_reports/` | Packer reports, Checker notes, maintenance reports |

Archive outdated Realm material instead of deleting it.

## 9. Stop Conditions
Stop and answer when:
- the fast-path answer is complete,
- Conceptualizer answered a framing-only request,
- Navigator found the requested location or material and no synthesis was requested,
- Packer produced a report and Checker passed or corrected it,
- Checker completed verification,
- a blocker prevents honest progress.

Do not continue only because another specialist could add more detail.

## 10. Final Response Contract
For framework edits, use:

1. Outcome
2. Changes
3. Validation
4. Notes, only if relevant

For research answers, include:
- short answer,
- evidence or report path,
- source paths,
- verification status,
- limits or unresolved gaps.

Never claim validation that was not performed.
